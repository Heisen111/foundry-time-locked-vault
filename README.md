## 🚧 Project Status

This repository contains the initial setup for **TimelockedVault**, a smart contract that securely locks user funds for a fixed duration before allowing withdrawal.

The project is currently **under active development**, and the contract logic, tests, and deployment scripts are still evolving.

Expect frequent changes to structure and functionality as new features and optimizations are introduced.

Documentation, detailed setup instructions, and usage examples will be added once the core contract is finalized.
